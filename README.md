# Kardz - it's like cards but cooler

A simple app where you play cards. That way I can play with my friends even when they're far away. Heartwarming, I know!

## Make your own rules

That's what I'm doing. Take advice from me; I'm great.

## Screenshots

I'm writing this readme before even cloning the repo to my machine. You're not meant to read this part... If you're reading this I have one question.
- Why are you here?
    
No seriously. If you're looking at this page before I even wrote any code, there's one of three explanations:

1. You need rehab for your addiction to reading commit histories of forgotten github repos.
1. You're stalking me.
    
In either case, I lightly recommend you modify your behavior and work on developing new hobbies.
